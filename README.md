Python Loop Assessment

#Created By SUJAL DEVKOTA

1. Pattern Printing: Write a Python program that prints the following
pattern using a nested for loop:
*
**
***
****
*****

Hint: You need two nested loops, one for the rows and one for the columns. Think
about how the number of asterisks in each row is related to the row number.


2. Prime Number Checker: Write a Python program that takes a number
as input and determines whether it is a prime number or not.

Hint: A prime number is a number greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and
itself. You can use a loop to check if the number is divisible by any number from 2
to the number itself (excluding the number).


4. Fibonacci Series: Write a Python program that generates the Fibonacci
series up to a specified number of terms.

Hint: The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum
of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. You can use a loop to generate
the series.


5. Palindrome Checker: Write a Python program that checks if a given
string is a palindrome.

Hint: A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that
reads the same forwards and backwards. You can use a loop to compare characters
from the start and end of the string. Examples of palindromes are: madam, radar,
refer etc.



Note: I took help from CHAT GPT for working mechanism of for loop because i was absent on 3/20/2024.
